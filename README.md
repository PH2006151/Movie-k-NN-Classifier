# Movie Genre Classification with k-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project implements a **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier** to predict movie genres using numerical feature vectors derived from movie metadata and ratings data.  
The project was completed as part of **UC Berkeley Data 8: Foundations of Data Science**.

The goal was to explore how distance-based classifiers perform on real-world data and to evaluate model accuracy across different hyperparameter choices.

## Methods & Techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and normalization
- k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification
- Training vs. test accuracy evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning for different values of *k*

## Tools Used
- Python
- Data 8 Tables Library
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Results
- Compared classifier accuracy across multiple values of *k*
- Identified tradeoffs between underfitting and overfitting
- Visualized classification error to determine an appropriate model configuration

## File Structure
